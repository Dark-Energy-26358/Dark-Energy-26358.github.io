The team shaping up and off to the races.
Looking forward to the [Sept 7th kick of at NC A&T](https://www.ncfllandftc.com/ftc-season-structure.html).
We are all looking forward to them publishing the schedule for that day, and updating their website.

Our [team's github repo](https://github.com/Dark-Energy-26358) is set up.

We are ready to make a splash in this year's [INTO THE DEEP](https://info.firstinspires.org/first-dive).
