Our robotics team, Dark Energy, recently spent a productive day filled with teambuilding activities and practical learning experiences. We started our day at a Nmu, where we enjoyed playing Magic: The Gathering and bonding in their amazing Korean garden. This relaxed setting allowed us to connect and strengthen our team spirit. We also have the opportunity to interview and connect with other homeschool students that are potential members of our team.

After our time at the Namu, we headed back to the lab to dive into some serious work. Our first task was to discuss the design of our team logo and costumes. We unanimously agreed on a lightning bolt with a flat top and two zigzag sides, enclosed within a circle. Our goal is to make the logo look more digital and less like a soccer team emblem.

Next, we moved on to sorting screws by size, which turned out to be an essential skill for our robotics projects. We then took apart the robot that our coaches had built, which was both an exciting and educational experience. This activity taught us valuable lessons about organization and careful disassembly.

**Team Insights**:

- **Ethan** learned the importance of thinking before taking things apart, the necessity of taking pictures throughout the process, and the value of sorting components meticulously.
- **Raahi** discovered the complexity of robots, the critical role of organization, and the variety of coding languages used in robotics. He also realized that a diverse team is crucial for success.
- **Roald** emphasized the importance of keeping components organized and sorting bolts, washers, and framing parts separately.
Overall, this day was a fantastic mix of fun and learning. We are excited to apply these lessons to our future projects and continue growing as a team.
