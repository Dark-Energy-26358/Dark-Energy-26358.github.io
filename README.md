# Dark Energy \#26358 page

This repo is the code behind https://darkenergy.team/
and works with a "static site generator" (SSG) call Jekyll.

Jekyll takes markdown and produces HTML. Shazaam.

## Markdown

Markdown files are just text files.
Any text editor works fine.
Things like vscode can do local previews of the formatting, which is helpful.

For syntax and formatting, this [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is helpful.

## New posts

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
